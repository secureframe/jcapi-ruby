  # unit tests for get_commands_command_id_associations
  # List the associations of a Command
  # This endpoint will return the _direct_ associations of this Command.  A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Commands and User Groups.   #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/commands/{Command_ID}/associations?targets&#x3D;system_group \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # @param targets 
  # @param accept 
  # @param content_type 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit The number of records to return at once. Limited to 100.

  # unit tests for get_commands_command_id_systemgroups
  # List the System Groups bound to a Command
  # This endpoint will return all System Groups bound to a Command, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.  Each element will contain the group&#39;s type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this Command to the corresponding System Group; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System Group from this Command.  See &#x60;/members&#x60; and &#x60;/associations&#x60; endpoints to manage those collections.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/commands/{Command_ID}/systemgroups \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # @option opts [Integer] :skip The offset into the records to return.
